\section{A Theory of Souping}
\subsection{Why does Souping Work?}
Theoretical motivation. Averaging out of noise. Does this lead to a prediction of how much gain in performance we should expect?
\subsection{A Toy Model}
Demonstrate noise reduction on a theoretical model (high-dim Guassian?), and a toy model.
\subsection{Defining Soupability}
What does it mean for models to be soupable? Define metrics for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution soupability.
