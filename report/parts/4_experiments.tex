\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Method}
What models did we use? What data? What loss function? On what cluster/GPU? How long did it take to run? How many models?
\subsection{Predicting Soupability}
What experiments did we run to test our ability to predict soupability? How well did we do? What correlates/doesn't? Is there stuff that's cool to put in the appendix?

What about predicting soupability of $A$ to $C$ given the soupability of $A$ to $B$ and $B$ to $C$?

\subsection{Validating the Theory}
What experiments did we run to validate our theory of souping? Do we get the noise reduction we expect?
